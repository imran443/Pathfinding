# Pathfinding
Final project for my algorithms class, shows the performance between different path finding algorithms.

# Instructions
To run the program Python 3 is required. As well as a library called Numpy which can be installed from acquired either from pip (Package manager for Python) or this link: https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html.

The program once started has a simple text interface which will lead you through what to type. The results will be saved to a file and should appear on the same level at the main.py file. The name of the file can be changed at the top of the `main.py` file. You can change the name of the variable fileName which is located at the top. 

There is some commented code in the `main.py` which can be ignored. It was basically used to print out the results from each run to text files. After running a specific algorithm, a GUI will appear with the results. You will need to run the program again after closing the GUI.


## The following 3 algorithms are used currently:

- Dikjstra's Algorithm
- A*
- Jump Point Search
